This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a simple map that has buttons to toggle the visiblity for two different data sets.  It can display the initials of problematic landlords and the description of building violations (this data set is limited as the implementation isn't developed enough to display the complete results of the api call in a helpful way).

## To Test This Project

- Clone the respository to your machine.

- run npm install or yarn install

- run npm start or yarn start to start a development version of the project and view it on http://localhost:3000/
